###DONUS (2016.06.16)
Introduced by 함종민 이사. Donus is a company under Crevisse, a startup complex. Crevisse is a "town" and has regular "town hall meetings" and seems to have a rather festive environment when it's Halloween. It seems attractive because the different startups have their own tables but are only few feet away from one another. This makes it easier for the startups to collaborate. They also pay less for the using the space, compared to if they were to rent a small sized room elsewhere. If one of the startups starts to do well and become famous, Crevisse will also become famous, leading to an overall appreciation of value of all Crevisse Startups. On the other hand, this might as well be true for the opposite case, when one startup gets caught in a scandal or fails: that one startup will lower the moral of all Crevisse startups.

However, I think Donus (or DONUS, I don't know which is the right spelling) won't have such a hard time because they managed to find a steady and high-paying item. They are a "donation fund solution" company, which provides companies the necessary digital framework for organizing a great amount of fund. NGOs, college alumni associations, and hospitals are their biggest customers.

DONUS has three main solutions, applied for different situations. More importantly, though, it is moving towards building a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution, so that the company doesn't have to spend time setting up solutions for individual companies. This was okay when they had a small group of clients, but in their new phase, their target clients are mid- to small-sized companies, which exist in greater abundance. To meet all their customers' needs, they have to move to a SaaS environment to reduce time spent on physically moving around. However, this branch is their new and experimental one, so we'll see.

They are currently looking for consultants and software engineers. In terms of software engineers, they are looking for people to work on and maintatin the "Donus Fundraising" product and for people to experimentally develop their new SaaS product. They say they require people who have experience with developing and managing OOP programs. They prefer people eager to solve engineering problems.
