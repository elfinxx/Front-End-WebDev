###File Management
1. Each project is given its own folder in which there exist the following.
	1. README file (.md if this project is to be uploaded on GitHub, any other file format if not) that explains what the project strives to achieve, the date of project progress, and issues or direction of development. If this project allows other people's participation either as contributor or user, specific details about how it can be done should be noted.
	1. Resources folder which will include any sourcecode files that are used frequently and commonly throughout different parts of the project. Inside this folder, structure as necessary. Examples are grid, font, initialization, etc.
	1. Assets folder which will include any other (non-sourcecode) files that are used commonly throughout the project or any files that simply don't fit in anywhere. Examples are logos, design layout psds, simon's birthday photo, fonts, etc. This can be used as a trash bin.
	1. Submodule folders which will each have their own folders named img and css.
1. Aside from the common folders which can have generic names, each file and folder should have names that are self-explanatory on what their roles are. When in need of using spaces or special characters in names, it is recommended to replace them with hyphens.
